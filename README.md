# PasswordGenerator

## Description

- This is my first JavaScript homework assignment for the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
- The homework assignment was to write a JavaScript that would work with an existing HTML and CSS to generate a random password, based on some User inputs. 
- In completing this assignment I was able to apply the lessons from week three: establishing variables, establishing arrays, using windows like prompt(), generate random numbers, establish functions, establish loops, use if/else statements, and draw a specific element from an array.

The following is a descktop screenshot of the final version of the webpage when it was first submitted for review:

The next few screenshots shows some of the prompt, alert, and confirm windows used on the webpage.

## Credits

For this homework assignment, I applied what was taught in the third week of class and used the following first webpage as a major resource. The second link, demonstrates how to shuffle an array with an algorithm called "Fisher-Yates shuffle". I found the article very interesting and used the algorithm in my code: 
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

- [Shuffle An Array](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle)
